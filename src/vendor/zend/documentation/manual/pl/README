Required software:

- autoconf
- make
- xsltproc
- xmllint

On Windows, you should use Cygwin software or another port of GNU 
development tools.

How to build the DocBook documentation:

- run "autoconf" in this dir
- run "./configure" in this dir
- run "make"

The HTML files are rendered in the "html" dir.

When developing content, you can verify your changes by running:

  "make check"

This verifies the XML for the whole manual is valid.

You can verify your changes in a single file by running:

  "make XMLFILE=filename.xml check1"

The filename.xml is relative to the "module_specs" directory.

Also a CHM project file is prepared to create CHM help files on the fly.
You need to install the MsHtmlHelpWorkshop.

To build the CHM file from within the commandshell go to the directory
where your html files are build by using make as described before.
Then call:
 "C:/path/to/workshop/hhc htmlhelp.hhp"
where "C:/path/to/workshop/" is the path to you installation of MsHtmlHelpWorkshop

This will build a "Zend_Framework_LANGUAGE.chm" file.
Within the file you will find a index and in future also a table of content.
