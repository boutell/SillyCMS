    <para>
        <classname>Zend_Wildfire</classname> is a component that facilitates communication
        between <acronym>PHP</acronym> code and
        <ulink url="http://www.wildfirehq.org/">Wildfire</ulink> client components.
    </para>

    <para>
        The purpose of the Wildfire Project is to develop standardized communication channels
        between a large variety of components and a dynamic and scriptable plugin architecture. At
        this time, the primary focus is to provide a system that allows server-side
        <acronym>PHP</acronym> code to inject logging messages into the
        <ulink url="http://www.getfirebug.com/">Firebug Console</ulink>.
    </para>

    <para>
        The <link
            linkend="zend.log.writers.firebug"><classname>Zend_Log_Writer_Firebug</classname></link>
        component is provided for the purpose of logging to Firebug, and a communication protocol
        has been developed that uses <acronym>HTTP</acronym> request and response headers to send
        data between the server and client components. It is great for logging intelligence data to
        the browser that is generated during script execution, without interfering with the page
        content. With this approach, it is possible to debug <acronym>AJAX</acronym> requests that
        require clean <acronym>JSON</acronym> and <acronym>XML</acronym> responses.
    </para>

    <para>
        There is also a <link
            linkend="zend.db.profiler.profilers.firebug"><classname>Zend_Db_Profiler_Firebug</classname></link>
        component to log database profiling information to Firebug.
