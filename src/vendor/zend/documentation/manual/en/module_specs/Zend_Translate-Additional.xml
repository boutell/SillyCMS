    <title>Additional features for translation</title>

    <para>
        There are several additional features which are supported by
        <classname>Zend_Translate</classname>. Read here for these additional informations.

        <title>Options for adapters</title>

        <para>
            Options can be used with all adapters. Of course the options are different for all
            adapters. You can set options when you create the adapter. Actually there is one option
            which is available to all adapters: '<emphasis>clear</emphasis>' sets if translation
            data should be added to existing one or not. Standard behaviour is to add new
            translation data to existing one. But the translation data is only cleared for the
            selected language. So other languages remain untouched.
        </para>

        <para>
            You can set options temporarily by giving them to
            <methodname>addTranslation()</methodname>. And you can use the method
            <methodname>setOptions()</methodname> to set options permanent.

            When you want to have self defined options, you are also able to use them within all
            adapters. The <methodname>setOptions()</methodname> method can be used to define your
            option. <methodname>setOptions()</methodname> needs an array with the options you want
            to set. If an given option exists it will be signed over. You can define as much options
            as needed as they will not be checked by the adapter. Just make sure not to overwrite
            any existing option which is used by an adapter.
        </para>

        <para>
            To return the option you can use the <methodname>getOptions()</methodname> method. When
            <methodname>getOptions()</methodname> is called without a parameter it will return all
            options set. When the optional parameter is given you will only get the specified
            option.

        <title>Handling languages</title>

        <para>
            When working with different languages there are a few methods which will be useful.
        </para>

        <para>
            The <methodname>getLocale()</methodname> method can be used to get the currently set
            language. It can either hold an instance of <classname>Zend_Locale</classname> or the
            identifier of a locale.
        </para>

        <para>
            The <methodname>setLocale()</methodname> method sets a new standard language for
            translation. This prevents the need of setting the optional language parameter more than
            once to the <methodname>translate()</methodname> method. If the given language does not
            exist, or no translation data is available for the language,
            <methodname>setLocale()</methodname> tries to downgrade to the language without the
            region if any was given. A language of <emphasis>en_US</emphasis> would be downgraded to
            <emphasis>en</emphasis>. When even the downgraded language can not be found an exception
            will be thrown.
        </para>

        <para>
            The <methodname>isAvailable()</methodname> method checks if a given language is already
            available. It returns <constant>TRUE</constant> if data for the given language exist.
        </para>

        <para>
            And finally the <methodname>getList()</methodname> method can be used to get all
            currently set languages for an adapter returned as array.

            Not every message ID can be translated. But sometimes is can be useful to output the

            the locale for which you want to do the check. The optional second parameter declares
            whether translation is fixed to the declared language or a lower set of translations
            can be used. If you have a text which can be returned for 'en' but not for 'en_US' you

                every request for a message which can not be translated will be logged. Be aware,

        <para>
            This feature can not only be used to log messages but also to attach this untranslated

            The <methodname>getMessageIds($locale = null)</methodname> method returns all known

        </para>

        <para>
            The <methodname>getMessages($locale = null)</methodname> method returns the complete

            as value.
        </para>

        <para>
            Both methods accept an optional parameter <varname>$locale</varname> which, if set,
            returns the translation data for the specified language. If this parameter is not given,
            the actual set language will be used. Keep in mind that normally all translations should
            be available in all languages. Which means that in a normal situation you will not have
            to set this parameter.
        </para>

        <para>
            Additionally the <methodname>getMessages()</methodname> method can be used to return the
