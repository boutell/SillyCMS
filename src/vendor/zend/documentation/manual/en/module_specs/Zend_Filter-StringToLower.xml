    <para>
        This filter converts any input to be lowercased.

    <para>
        Per default it will only handle characters from the actual locale of your
        server. Characters from other charsets would be ignored. Still, it's
        possible to also lowercase them when the mbstring extension is available
        in your environment. Simply set the wished encoding when initiating the
        <classname>StringToLower</classname> filter. Or use the
        <methodname>setEncoding()</methodname> method to change the encoding afterwards.
    </para>

    <programlisting language="php"><![CDATA[
// using UTF-8
$filter = new Zend_Filter_StringToLower('UTF-8');

// or give an array which can be useful when using a configuration
$filter = new Zend_Filter_StringToLower(array('encoding' => 'UTF-8'));

// or do this afterwards
$filter->setEncoding('ISO-8859-1');
]]></programlisting>

        <para>
            Be aware that you will get an exception when you want to set an encoding
            and the mbstring extension is not available in your environment.
        </para>

        <para>
            Also when you are trying to set an encoding which is not supported by your
            mbstring extension you will get an exception.
