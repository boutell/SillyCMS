    <title>Query Language</title>

    <para>
        Java Lucene and <classname>Zend_Search_Lucene</classname> provide quite powerful query
        languages.
    </para>

    <para>
        These languages are mostly the same with some minor differences, which are mentioned below.
    </para>

    <para>
        Full Java Lucene query language syntax documentation can be found

    </para>

    <sect2 id="zend.search.lucene.query-language.terms">
        <title>Terms</title>

        <para>
            A query is broken up into terms and operators. There are three types of terms: Single
            Terms, Phrases, and Subqueries.
        </para>

        <para>
            A Single Term is a single word such as "test" or "hello".
        </para>

        <para>
            A Phrase is a group of words surrounded by double quotes such as "hello dolly".
        </para>

        <para>
            A Subquery is a query surrounded by parentheses such as "(hello dolly)".
        </para>

        <para>
            Multiple terms can be combined together with boolean operators to form complex queries
            (see below).

        <title>Fields</title>

        <para>
            Lucene supports fields of data. When performing a search you can either specify a field,
            or use the default field. The field names depend on indexed data and default field is
            defined by current settings.
        </para>

        <para>
            The first and most significant difference from Java Lucene is that terms are searched
            through <emphasis>all fields</emphasis> by default.
        </para>

        <para>
            There are two static methods in the <classname>Zend_Search_Lucene</classname> class
            which allow the developer to configure these settings:
        </para>

        <programlisting language="php"><![CDATA[
$defaultSearchField = Zend_Search_Lucene::getDefaultSearchField();
...
Zend_Search_Lucene::setDefaultSearchField('contents');
]]></programlisting>

        <para>
            The <constant>NULL</constant> value indicated that the search is performed across all
            fields. It's the default setting.
        </para>

        <para>
            You can search specific fields by typing the field name followed by a colon ":" followed
            by the term you are looking for.
        </para>

        <para>
            As an example, let's assume a Lucene index contains two fields- title and text- with
            text as the default field. If you want to find the document entitled "The Right Way"
            which contains the text "don't go this way", you can enter:
        </para>

        <programlisting language="querystring"><![CDATA[
title:"The Right Way" AND text:go
]]></programlisting>

        <para>
            or
        </para>

        <programlisting language="querystring"><![CDATA[
title:"Do it right" AND go
]]></programlisting>

        <para>
            Because "text" is the default field, the field indicator is not required.
        </para>

        <para>
            Note: The field is only valid for the term, phrase or subquery that it directly
            precedes, so the query
        </para>

        <programlisting language="querystring"><![CDATA[
title:Do it right
]]></programlisting>

        <para>
            Will only find "Do" in the title field. It will find "it" and "right" in the default
            field (if the default field is set) or in all indexed fields (if the default field is
            set to <constant>NULL</constant>).
        </para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="zend.search.lucene.query-language.wildcard">
        <title>Wildcards</title>

        <para>
            Lucene supports single and multiple character wildcard searches within single terms (but
            not within phrase queries).
        </para>

        <para>
            To perform a single character wildcard search use the "?" symbol.
        </para>

        <para>
            To perform a multiple character wildcard search use the "*" symbol.
        </para>

        <para>
            The single character wildcard search looks for string that match the term with the "?"
            replaced by any single character. For example, to search for "text" or "test" you can
            use the search:
        </para>

        <programlisting language="querystring"><![CDATA[
te?t
]]></programlisting>

        <para>
            Multiple character wildcard searches look for 0 or more characters when matching strings
            against terms. For example, to search for test, tests or tester, you can use the search:
        </para>

        <programlisting language="querystring"><![CDATA[
test*
]]></programlisting>

        <para>
            You can use "?", "*" or both at any place of the term:
        </para>

        <programlisting language="querystring"><![CDATA[
*wr?t*
]]></programlisting>

        <para>
            It searches for "write", "wrote", "written", "rewrite", "rewrote" and so on.
        </para>

        <para>
            Starting from ZF 1.7.7 wildcard patterns need some non-wildcard prefix. Default prefix
            length is 3 (like in Java Lucene). So "*", "te?t", "*wr?t*" terms will cause an
            exception

            <footnote>

            <classname>Zend_Search_Lucene</classname> as well as Java Lucene supports fuzzy searches
            based on the Levenshtein Distance, or Edit Distance algorithm. To do a fuzzy search use
            the tilde, "~", symbol at the end of a Single word Term. For example to search for a
            term similar in spelling to "roam" use the fuzzy search:
        </para>

        <programlisting language="querystring"><![CDATA[
roam~
]]></programlisting>

        <para>
            This search will find terms like foam and roams. Additional (optional) parameter can
            specify the required similarity. The value is between 0 and 1, with a value closer to 1
            only terms with a higher similarity will be matched. For example:
        </para>

        <programlisting language="querystring"><![CDATA[
roam~0.8

        <para>
            So <classname>Zend_Search_Lucene</classname> sets a limit of matching terms per query

        <para>
            Lucene supports finding words from a phrase that are within a specified word distance in
            a string. To do a proximity search use the tilde, "~", symbol at the end of the phrase.
            For example to search for a "Zend" and "Framework" within 10 words of each other in a

        <title>Boosting a Term</title>

        <para>
            Java Lucene and <classname>Zend_Search_Lucene</classname> provide the relevance level of
            matching documents based on the terms found. To boost the relevance of a term use the
            caret, "^", symbol with a boost factor (a number) at the end of the term you are
            searching. The higher the boost factor, the more relevant the term will be.
        </para>

        <para>

        <para>
            and you want the term "PHP" to be more relevant boost it using the ^ symbol along with
            the boost factor next to the term. You would type:
        </para>

        <programlisting language="querystring"><![CDATA[
PHP^4 framework

        <para>
            This will make documents with the term <acronym>PHP</acronym> appear more relevant. You
            can also boost phrase terms and subqueries as in the example:
        </para>

        <programlisting language="querystring"><![CDATA[
"PHP framework"^4 "Zend Framework"
]]></programlisting>

        <para>
            By default, the boost factor is 1. Although the boost factor must be positive,
            it may be less than 1 (e.g. 0.2).

        <title>Boolean Operators</title>

        <para>
            Boolean operators allow terms to be combined through logic operators.
            Lucene supports AND, "+", OR, NOT and "-" as Boolean operators.
            Java Lucene requires boolean operators to be ALL CAPS.
            <classname>Zend_Search_Lucene</classname> does not.

            allow these two styles to be mixed.
        </para>

        <para>
            If the AND/OR/NOT style is used, then an AND or OR operator must be present between all
            query terms. Each term may also be preceded by NOT operator. The AND operator has higher
            precedence than the OR operator. This differs from Java Lucene behavior.

        <title>Escaping Special Characters</title>

        <para>
            Lucene supports escaping special characters that are used in query syntax. The current
            list of special characters is:
        </para>

        <para>
            + - &amp;&amp; || ! ( ) { } [ ] ^ " ~ * ? : \
        </para>

        <para>
            + and - inside single terms are automatically treated as common characters.
        </para>

        <para>
            For other instances of these characters use the \ before each special character you'd
            like to escape. For example to search for (1+1):2 use the query:
        </para>

        <programlisting language="querystring"><![CDATA[
\(1\+1\)\:2
