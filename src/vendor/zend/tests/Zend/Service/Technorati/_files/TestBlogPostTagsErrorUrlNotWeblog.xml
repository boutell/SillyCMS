    Error response returned for a Blogposttags request
    http://api.technorati.com/blogposttags?key=VALID_API_KEY&url=www.simonecarletti.com
    
    The request has the following properties:
     * url is a site, not a claimed blog
    
    Please note how this request is considered an error because `url`
    is not a claimed blog.
    The same request for `Bloginfo` simple returns the blog URL
    and is not considered as an error.
