README
======

SillyCMS is a really simple Wiki built in Symfony 2 and Doctrine 2 as a 
learning project for Symfony 2. It is not a world-rocking, life-changing
CMS for your client projects. 

Right now the show action works, so you can visit http://sillycms/app_dev.php
and see the home page if you have manually inserted one into the page table.
You can load two pages, / (homepage) and /about (the about page), by loading
the provided sillycms.sql file. To visit the about page go to
http://sillycms/app_dev.php/about

The edit action ( http://sillycms/app_dev.php/admin/edit ) is under
construction. MAKE SURE YOUR PHP HAS THE intl EXTENSION if you get errors
about a missing Locale class. For instance, for MacPorts:

port install php5-intl

The rest of this README is the original Symfony 2 sandbox README.

IMPORTANT: I am using .yml config files, please ignore .xml and .php
config files left over from the sandbox. Symfony seems to use the most
recently modified, which would be my .yml files.

What is Symfony?
----------------

Symfony is a PHP 5.3 full-stack web framework. It is written with speed and
flexibility in mind. It allows developers to built better and easy to maintain
websites with PHP.

Symfony can be used to develop all kind of websites, from your personal blog
to high traffic ones like Dailymotion or Yahoo! Answers.

High Performance
----------------

Built with performance in mind, Symfony 2 is one of the fastest PHP
frameworks. It is up to 3 times faster than symfony 1.4 or Zend Framework 1.10
and consumes half the memory.

Requirements
------------

Symfony is only supported on PHP 5.3.2 and up. To check the compatibility of
your environment with Symfony, you can run the `web/check.php` script, bundled
with this sandbox.

Documentation
-------------

Symfony 2.0 is still in the early stages of development, but the "[Quick Tour][1]"
tutorial can get you started fast.

The "Quick Tour" tutorial barely scratches the surface of Symfony 2.0 but it
gives you a first feeling of the framework. If, like us, you think that
Symfony 2.0 can help speed up your development and take the quality of your
work to the next level, visit the official [Symfony 2 website][2] to learn
about it.
