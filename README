README
======

SillyCMS is a really simple Wiki built in Symfony 2 and Doctrine 2 as a 
learning project for Symfony 2. It is not a world-rocking, life-changing
CMS for your client projects. 

To try it out, build your database (it will be called sillycms):

php app/console doctrine:database:create
php app/console doctrine:schema:create

Make sure the web folder is document root and visit the site:

http://sillycms/app_dev.php

The home page doesn't exist yet so log in, click Edit and provide some content.

Now access another page:

http://sillycms/app_dev.php/coolbeans

And provide content for that page.

Notice that both pages now appear in the navigation list at the left.

A simple Wiki syntax is supported. You can create headings:

= Heading =
== Lesser Heading ==
=== Even Lesser Heading ===

URLs are automatically transformed into links, and you can create convenient links
to other Wiki pages by putting their titles in double brackets:

[[title]]

This demonstrates our success in registering a Twig filter as a Symfony bundle.

MAKE SURE YOUR PHP HAS THE intl EXTENSION if you get errors
about a missing Locale class. For instance, for MacPorts:

port install php5-intl

IMPORTANT: I am using .yml config files, please ignore .xml and .php
config files left over from the sandbox. Symfony seems to honor the most
recently modified, which would be my .yml files.

TODO

* Add multiuser security using Doctrine objects and Symfony 2 ACLs; go beyond the in-memory user provider

What is Symfony?
----------------

Symfony is a PHP 5.3 full-stack web framework. It is written with speed and
flexibility in mind. It allows developers to built better and easy to maintain
websites with PHP.

Symfony can be used to develop all kind of websites, from your personal blog
to high traffic ones like Dailymotion or Yahoo! Answers.

High Performance
----------------

Built with performance in mind, Symfony 2 is one of the fastest PHP
frameworks. It is up to 3 times faster than symfony 1.4 or Zend Framework 1.10
and consumes half the memory.

Requirements
------------

Symfony is only supported on PHP 5.3.2 and up. To check the compatibility of
your environment with Symfony, you can run the `web/check.php` script, bundled
with this sandbox.

Documentation
-------------

Symfony 2.0 is still in the early stages of development, but the "[Quick Tour][1]"
tutorial can get you started fast.

The "Quick Tour" tutorial barely scratches the surface of Symfony 2.0 but it
gives you a first feeling of the framework. If, like us, you think that
Symfony 2.0 can help speed up your development and take the quality of your
work to the next level, visit the official [Symfony 2 website][2] to learn
about it.
