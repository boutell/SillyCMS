README
======

SillyCMS is a really simple Wiki built in Symfony 2 and Doctrine 2 as a 
learning project for Symfony 2. It is not a world-rocking, life-changing
CMS for your client projects. 

To try it out, build your database (it will be called sillycms):

php app/console doctrine:database:create
php app/console doctrine:schema:create

Make sure the web folder is document root and visit the site:

http://sillycms/app_dev.php

The home page doesn't exist yet so click Edit and provide some content.

Now access another page:

http://sillycms/app_dev.php/coolbeans

And provide content for that page.

Notice that both pages now appear in the navigation list at the left.

MAKE SURE YOUR PHP HAS THE intl EXTENSION if you get errors
about a missing Locale class. For instance, for MacPorts:

port install php5-intl

IMPORTANT: I am using .yml config files, please ignore .xml and .php
config files left over from the sandbox. Symfony seems to honor the most
recently modified, which would be my .yml files.

TODO

* Figure out the right place to add some kind of Wiki formatting rules to
the code - is there any way to get the equivalent of the old simple_format_text helper
in Twig-land?

* Add login security, the right way using Fabien's firewall model, in order
to learn more about that.

The rest of this README is the original Symfony 2 sandbox README.

What is Symfony?
----------------

Symfony is a PHP 5.3 full-stack web framework. It is written with speed and
flexibility in mind. It allows developers to built better and easy to maintain
websites with PHP.

Symfony can be used to develop all kind of websites, from your personal blog
to high traffic ones like Dailymotion or Yahoo! Answers.

High Performance
----------------

Built with performance in mind, Symfony 2 is one of the fastest PHP
frameworks. It is up to 3 times faster than symfony 1.4 or Zend Framework 1.10
and consumes half the memory.

Requirements
------------

Symfony is only supported on PHP 5.3.2 and up. To check the compatibility of
your environment with Symfony, you can run the `web/check.php` script, bundled
with this sandbox.

Documentation
-------------

Symfony 2.0 is still in the early stages of development, but the "[Quick Tour][1]"
tutorial can get you started fast.

The "Quick Tour" tutorial barely scratches the surface of Symfony 2.0 but it
gives you a first feeling of the framework. If, like us, you think that
Symfony 2.0 can help speed up your development and take the quality of your
work to the next level, visit the official [Symfony 2 website][2] to learn
about it.
