 * be secured against CSRF attacks. This value doesn't necessarily have to be
 * secret. Implementations of this interface are responsible for adding more
 * secret information.
 *
 * If you want to secure a form submission against CSRF attacks, you could
 * use the class name of the form as page ID. This way you make sure that the
 * form can only be submitted to pages that are designed to handle the form,
 * that is, that use the same class name to validate the CSRF token with
 * isCsrfTokenValid().
