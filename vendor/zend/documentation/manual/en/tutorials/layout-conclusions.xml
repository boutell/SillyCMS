    <title>Zend_Layout: Conclusions</title>

    <para>
        <classname>Zend_Layout</classname> is a very simple wrapper around
        <classname>Zend_View</classname> which provides you immediately with the benefits of a Two
        Step View, giving you the flexibility to create a site-wide design into which you may inject
        your application content.

        If you're looking closely at the examples, however, you may come away with the idea that the
        functionality is relatively limited: how do you alter the page title, inject an optional
        script tag, or even create an optional sidebar? These questions are addressed with the
        concept of a "Composite View" -- and are the subject of the next chapter in the tutorial,
        which covers view "placeholders."
