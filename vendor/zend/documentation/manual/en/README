- run "./configure" in this dir
- run "make"

The HTML files are rendered in the "html" dir.

When developing content, you can verify your changes by running:

  "make check"

This verifies the XML for the whole manual is valid.

You can verify your changes in a single file by running:

To generat a CHM project file, you must install MsHtmlHelpWorkshop.

To build the CHM file on the command line navigate to the directory
in which the manual html files are built as described above

Then call:
 
 "C:/path/to/workshop/hhc htmlhelp.hhp"
 
where "C:/path/to/workshop/" is the path to MsHtmlHelpWorkshop.

This will build a "Zend_Framework_LANGUAGE.chm" file.

 You should now have an index in the file..
