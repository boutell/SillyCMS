            Nevertheless it's a good idea not to use '<emphasis>id</emphasis>' and

            Indexing performance is a compromise between used resources, indexing time and index
            quality.
        </para>

        <para>
            Index quality is completely determined by number of index segments.
        </para>

        <para>
            Each index segment is entirely independent portion of data. So indexes containing more
            segments need more memory and time for searching.
        </para>

        <para>
            Index optimization is a process of merging several segments into a new one. A fully
            optimized index contains only one segment.
        </para>

        <para>
            Full index optimization may be performed with the <methodname>optimize()</methodname>

        <para>
            Index optimization works with data streams and doesn't take a lot of memory but does
            require processor resources and time.
        </para>

        <para>
            Lucene index segments are not updatable by their nature (the update operation requires
            the segment file to be completely rewritten). So adding new document(s) to an index
            always generates a new segment. This, in turn, decreases index quality.
        </para>

        <para>
            An index auto-optimization process is performed after each segment generation and
            consists of merging partial segments.

            There are three options to control the behavior of auto-optimization (see <link

            <emphasis>MaxBufferedDocs</emphasis> doesn't have any effect if you index only one
            document per script execution. On the other hand, it's very important for batch
            indexing. Greater values increase indexing performance, but also require more memory.
        </para>

        <para>
            There is simply no way to calculate the best value for the
            <emphasis>MaxBufferedDocs</emphasis> parameter because it depends on average document
            size, the analyzer in use and allowed memory.
        </para>

        <para>
            A good way to find the right value is to perform several tests with the largest document
            you expect to be added to the index

                </para>
            </footnote>

            . It's a best practice not to use more than a half of the allowed memory.
        </para>

        <para>
            <emphasis>MaxMergeDocs</emphasis> limits the segment size (in terms of documents). It
            therefore also limits auto-optimization time by guaranteeing that the
            <methodname>addDocument()</methodname> method is not executed more than a certain number
            of times. This is very important for interactive applications.
        </para>

        <para>
            Lowering the <emphasis>MaxMergeDocs</emphasis> parameter also may improve batch indexing
            performance. Index auto-optimization is an iterative process and is performed from
            bottom up. Small segments are merged into larger segment, which are in turn merged into
            even larger segments and so on. Full index optimization is achieved when only one large
            segment file remains.
        </para>

        <para>
            Small segments generally decrease index quality. Many small segments may also trigger
            the "Too many open files" error determined by OS limitations

                <para>
                    <classname>Zend_Search_Lucene</classname> keeps each segment file opened to

            </footnote>.
        </para>

        <para>
            in general, background index optimization should be performed for interactive indexing
            mode and <emphasis>MaxMergeDocs</emphasis> shouldn't be too low for batch indexing.
        </para>

        <para>
            <emphasis>MergeFactor</emphasis> affects auto-optimization frequency. Lower values
            increase the quality of unoptimized indexes. Larger values increase indexing
            performance, but also increase the number of merged segments. This again may trigger the
            "Too many open files" error.

            <classname>Zend_Search_Lucene</classname> checks during each

        </para>

        <para>
            So an index with N groups may contain <emphasis>MaxBufferedDocs</emphasis> +
            (N-1)*<emphasis>MergeFactor</emphasis> segments and contains at least
            <emphasis>MaxBufferedDocs</emphasis>*<emphasis>MergeFactor</emphasis><superscript>(N-1)</superscript>

        </para>

        <para>
            <emphasis>MaxBufferedDocs</emphasis> is determined by allowed memory. This allows for
            the appropriate merge factor to get a reasonable number of segments.
        </para>

        <para>
            Tuning the <emphasis>MergeFactor</emphasis> parameter is more effective for batch
            indexing performance than <emphasis>MaxMergeDocs</emphasis>. But it's also more
            course-grained. So use the estimation above for tuning <emphasis>MergeFactor</emphasis>,
            then play with <emphasis>MaxMergeDocs</emphasis> to get best batch indexing performance.

            The same approach is used to set query string encoding.

            If encoding is not specified, then the current locale is used to determine the encoding.

            If the correct encoding is specified it can be correctly processed by analyzer. The
            actual behavior depends on which analyzer is used. See the <link

            details.

            It should be clear that <classname>Zend_Search_Lucene</classname> as well as any other
            Lucene implementation does not comprise a "database".
        </para>

        <para>
            Indexes should not be used for data storage. They do not provide partial backup/restore
            functionality, journaling, logging, transactions and many other features associated with
            database management systems.
        </para>

        <para>
            Nevertheless, <classname>Zend_Search_Lucene</classname> attempts to keep indexes in a
            consistent state at all times.
        </para>

        <para>
            Index backup and restoration should be performed by copying the contents of the index
            folder.
        </para>

        <para>
            If index corruption occurs for any reason, the corrupted index should be restored or
            completely rebuilt.
        </para>

        <para>
            So it's a good idea to backup large indexes and store changelogs to perform manual
            restoration and roll-forward operations if necessary. This practice dramatically reduces
            index restoration time.
