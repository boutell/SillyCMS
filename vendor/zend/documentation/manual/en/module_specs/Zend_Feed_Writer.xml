        <para>
            <classname>Zend_Feed_Writer</classname> is the sibling component to
            <classname>Zend_Feed_Reader</classname> responsible for generating feeds for output. It
            supports the Atom 1.0 specification (<acronym>RFC</acronym> 4287) and
            <acronym>RSS</acronym> 2.0 as specified by the <acronym>RSS</acronym> Advisory Board
            (<acronym>RSS</acronym> 2.0.11). It does not deviate from these standards. It does,
            however, offer a simple Extension system which allows for any extension and module for
            either of these two specifications to be implemented if they are not provided out of the
            box.
        </para>

        <para>
            In many ways, <classname>Zend_Feed_Writer</classname> is the inverse of
            <classname>Zend_Feed_Reader</classname>. Where <classname>Zend_Feed_Reader</classname>
            focuses on providing an easy to use architecture fronted by getter methods,
            <classname>Zend_Feed_Writer</classname> is fronted by similarly named setters or
            mutators. This ensures the <acronym>API</acronym> won't pose a learning curve to anyone
            familiar with <classname>Zend_Feed_Reader</classname>.
        </para>

        <para>
            As a result of this design, the rest may even be obvious. Behind the scenes, data set on
            any <classname>Zend_Feed_Writer</classname> Data Container object is translated at
            render time onto a DOMDocument object using the necessary feed elements. For each
            supported feed type there is both an Atom 1.0 and <acronym>RSS</acronym> 2.0 renderer.
            Using a DOMDocument class rather than a templating solution has numerous advantages,
            the most obvious being the ability to export the DOMDocument for
            additional processing and relying on <acronym>PHP</acronym> <acronym>DOM</acronym> for
            correct and valid rendering.
        </para>

        <para>
            As with <classname>Zend_Feed_Reader</classname>, <classname>Zend_Feed_Writer</classname>
            is a standalone replacement for <classname>Zend_Feed</classname>'s Builder architecture
            and is not compatible with those classes.
        </para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="zend.feed.writer.architecture">
        <title>Architecture</title>

        <para>
            The architecture of <classname>Zend_Feed_Writer</classname> is very simple. It has two
            core sets of classes: data containers and renderers.
        </para>

        <para>
            The containers include the <classname>Zend_Feed_Writer_Feed</classname> and
            <classname>Zend_Feed_Writer_Entry</classname> classes. The Entry classes can be attached
            to any Feed class. The sole purpose of these containers is to collect data about the
            feed to generate using a simple interface of setter methods. These methods perform some
            data validity testing. For example, it will validate any passed <acronym>URI</acronym>s,
            dates, etc. These checks are not tied to any of the feed standards definitions. The
            container objects also contain methods to allow for fast rendering and export of the
            final feed, and these can be reused at will.
        </para>

        <para>
            In addition to the main data container classes, there are two additional Atom 2.0
            specific classes. <classname>Zend_Feed_Writer_Source</classname> and
            <classname>Zend_Feed_Writer_Deleted</classname>. The former implements Atom 2.0 source
            elements which carry source feed metadata for a specific entry within an aggregate feed
            (i.e. the current feed is not the entry's original source). The latter implements the
            Atom Tombstones <acronym>RFC</acronym> allowing feeds to carry references to entries
            which have been deleted.
        </para>

        <para>
            While there are two main data container types, there are four renderers - two matching
            container renderers per supported feed type. Each renderer accepts a container, and
            based on its content attempts to generate valid feed markup. If the renderer is unable
            to generate valid feed markup, perhaps due to the container missing an obligatory data
            point, it will report this by throwing an <classname>Exception</classname>. While it is
            possible to ignore <classname>Exception</classname>s, this removes the default safeguard
            of ensuring you have sufficient data set to render a wholly valid feed.
        </para>

        <para>
            To explain this more clearly, you may construct a set of data containers for a feed
            where there is a Feed container, into which has been added some Entry containers and a
            Deleted container. This forms a data hierarchy resembling a normal feed. When rendering
            is performed, this hierarchy has its pieces passed to relevant renderers and the partial
            feeds (all DOMDocuments) are then pieced together to create a complete feed. In the case
            of Source or Deleted (Tomestone) containers, these are rendered only for Atom 2.0 and
            ignored for <acronym>RSS</acronym>.
        </para>

        <para>
            Due to the system being divided between data containers and renderers, it can make
            Extensions somewhat interesting. A typical Extension offering namespaced feed and entry
            level elements, must itself reflect the exact same architecture, i.e. offer feed and
            entry level data containers, and matching renderers. There is, fortunately, no complex
            integration work required since all Extension classes are simply registered and
            automatically used by the core classes. We'll meet Extensions in more detail at the end
            of this section.

        <para>
            Using <classname>Zend_Feed_Writer</classname> is as simple as setting data and
            triggering the renderer. Here is an example to generate a minimal Atom 1.0 feed.
            As this demonstrates, each feed or entry uses a separate data container.

        <para>
            This is a perfectly valid Atom 1.0 example. It should be noted that omitting an
            obligatory point of data, such as a title, will trigger an
            <classname>Exception</classname> when rendering as Atom 1.0. This will differ for
            <acronym>RSS</acronym> 2.0 since a title may be omitted so long as a description is
            present. This gives rise to Exceptions that differ between the two standards depending
            on the renderer in use. By design, <classname>Zend_Feed_Writer</classname> will not
            render an invalid feed for either standard unless the end-user deliberately elects to
            ignore all Exceptions. This built in safeguard was added to ensure users without
            in-depth knowledge of the relevant specifications have a bit less to worry about.
        </para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="zend.feed.writer.setting.feed.data.points">
        <title>Setting Feed Data Points</title>

        <para>
            Before you can render a feed, you must first setup the data necessary for
            the feed being rendered. This utilises a simple setter style <acronym>API</acronym>
            which doubles as an initial method for validating the data being set. By design, the
            <acronym>API</acronym> closely matches that for <classname>Zend_Feed_Reader</classname>
            to avoid undue confusion and uncertainty.
        </para>

        <note>
            <para>Users have commented that the lack of a simple array based notation for input data
            gives rise to lengthy tracts of code. This will be addressed in a future release.</para>
        </note>

        <para>
            <classname>Zend_Feed_Writer</classname> offers this <acronym>API</acronym> via its data
            container classes <classname>Zend_Feed_Writer_Feed</classname> and
            <classname>Zend_Feed_Writer_Entry</classname> (not to mention the Atom 2.0 specific
            and Extension classes). These classes merely store
            all feed data in a type-agnostic manner, meaning you may reuse any data
            container with any renderer without requiring additional work. Both classes
            are also amenable to Extensions, meaning that an Extension may define its own
            container classes which are registered to the base container classes as extensions, and
            are checked when any method call triggers the base container's
            <methodname>__call()</methodname> method.
        </para>

        <para>
            Here's a summary of the Core <acronym>API</acronym> for Feeds. You should note it
            comprises not only the basic <acronym>RSS</acronym> and Atom standards, but also
            accounts for a number of included Extensions bundled with
            <classname>Zend_Feed_Writer</classname>. The naming of these
            Extension sourced methods remain fairly generic - all Extension
            methods operate at the same level as the Core <acronym>API</acronym> though we do allow
            you to retrieve any specific Extension object separately if required.

        <para>
            The Feed Level <acronym>API</acronym> for data is contained in
            <classname>Zend_Feed_Writer_Feed</classname>. In addition to the <acronym>API</acronym>
            detailed below, the class also implements the <classname>Countable</classname> and

                            and a Dublin Core creator element only containing the name.

                            rendered as the current date by default when not explicity set.

                            order for real-time updates to be enabled. A Publisher may be
                            implemented using

                            "scheme". The "term" is a typically a category name suitable for
                            inclusion in a <acronym>URI</acronym>. The "label" may be a human
                            readable category name supporting special characters (it is
                            <acronym>HTML</acronym> encoded during rendering) and is a required key.
                            The "scheme" (called the domain in <acronym>RSS</acronym>) is optional
                            but must be a valid <acronym>URI</acronym>. The method
                            <methodname>addCategory()</methodname> allows adding a single category

            Here's a summary of the Core <acronym>API</acronym> for Entries and Items. You should
            note it comprises not only the basic <acronym>RSS</acronym> and Atom standards, but
            also accounts for a number of included Extensions bundled with
            <classname>Zend_Feed_Writer</classname>. The naming of these
            Extension sourced methods remain fairly generic - all Extension
            methods operate at the same level as the Core <acronym>API</acronym> though we do allow
            you to retrieve any specific Extension object separately if required.

                            Accepts an array of categories for rendering, where each element is
                            itself an array whose possible keys include "term", "label" and
                            "scheme". The "term" is a typically a category name suitable for
                            inclusion in a <acronym>URI</acronym>. The "label" may be a human
                            readable category name supporting special characters (it is encoded
                            during rendering) and is a required key. The "scheme" (called the domain
                            in <acronym>RSS</acronym>) is optional but must be a valid
                            <acronym>URI</acronym>.
